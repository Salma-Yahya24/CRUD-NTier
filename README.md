# CRUD N-Tier Application

This is a simple N-Tier architecture CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application built using ASP.NET MVC. The application follows a clean separation of concerns by dividing the application into three layers:

- **Client (UI Layer)** - Handles the user interface.
- **DAL (Data Access Layer)** - Manages data interaction with the database.
- **Entities (Model Layer)** - Defines the data structures used throughout the application.

## Features
- CRUD Operations for **Product** and **Category**.
- Clean architecture following the N-Tier pattern.
- Unit of Work pattern for efficient database management.
- Bootstrap styling for improved user interface.
